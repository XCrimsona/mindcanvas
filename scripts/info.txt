The .bat I wrote here are 100% safe. It does not put anyone's data at risk and the they windows os based executable files. 

The MindCanvasDemo.bat can be stored on your deskto screen. 
You can move MindCanvasDemo.bat out of the script folder to whereever. 
That file that starts the whole program and require some configuration setup.

The docs will help you

WARNING:
Do NOT use AI to modify the .bat code. 
Html, css, js are ok but never use ai to write .bat files if you are vibe coding with zero programming experience. 

Doing that puts your entire hardrive data at risk and I will NOT be held liable for that.

I use:
cd = to change directory
echo = to print text in the terminal so you know what the code does in .bat files

I use AI myself to understand .bat code but I never let it write from C:/ drive level on my own machine either as that is seriously not a good idea given what AI can do on OS systems at this time.

TIP:If you want to do that, play with that attitude using virtual machines > windows iso

As a developer its my utmost duty to know what each lines of code I write does to ensure the code written does NOT override any data that belongs to others.
